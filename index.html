Having a natural desire to pursue his love for studio art he later attended The Savannah College of Art & Design in Georgia where he received his BFA with high honors. While all his friends moved to cities around the US after college, Ryan instead chose to move to the quiet mountain town of Asheville, North Carolina, home of The Black Mountain College. There he spent the next four years living in an old feed factory with a crew of like-minded artists where they collectively curated art shows and performances. Then in 2006 he opened the door to two photographers from the New York Times asking if they could shoot photos of him in his studio where upon he ended up in a two page spread in the New York Times Style Magazine. Already with addled feelings of outgrowing the small southern town, the interaction with the big shot photographers helped propel Ryan to move to New York City. Later that same year Ford landed on his friends couch in Bushwick, Brooklyn where he resides to this day. His original inspirations derive from 12th- 15th century Sienese paintings, Philip Guston, Francis Bacon, & pop culture video games. An artist known for comic symbolic abstraction, Ford delves a bit deeper into his psyche; his work titillates the mind with streaks of quiet violence and provocative tranquility. Although his work sometimes deals with serious topics and themes they are never without a mix of humor, pure absurdity and ridiculousness.</div></div><div id=section4><div class=container><h2>Bibliography - Periodcals</h2><p>2013 ARTIST ROOMS: Jeff Koons.
